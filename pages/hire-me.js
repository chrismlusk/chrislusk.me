            Hi! I'm <Highlight>Chris Lusk</Highlight>.
            <span className="wave" aria-hidden="true">

        <LeadBlurb>
          I'm a full-stack software developer who enjoys working at the
          intersection of engineering and design. I'm ready for a new
          opportunity. Let's work together!
        </LeadBlurb>
        <h2>What</h2>
        <p>I'm looking for a full-stack engineering role.</p>
        <p>Ideally you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Have a diverse team with diverse leadership</li>
          <li>Pay your staff fairly with no wage discrimination</li>
          <li>Have product, design, and engineering teams that collaborate</li>
          <li>Offer professional development opportunities</li>
          <li>Have great work/life balance</li>
          <li>Provide vacation, parental leave, and 401k matching</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When</h2>
        <p>I am available January 2019.</p>

        <h2>Where</h2>
        <p>Chicago, Illinois. I am open to remote positions.</p>

        <h2>Why</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a developer with experience throughout the whole stack. I value
          pair programming and mentoring, so collaboration with colleagues is
          essential to me. I have a deep understanding of design, and I care
          about building intuitive user experiences. I enjoy writing CSS. I
          believe accessibility and performance are vital because the internet
          should be available to everyone. I love learning new technologies, but
          we should be more concerned with choosing the right tool for the job.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have experience working with JavaScript, CSS/Sass, React, Redux,
          Node, Express, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you think I would be a good fit for your team, please email me at
          chrismlusk[at]gmail.com.
